## Description

_This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbrs from 0 to their inputted number with some surprise messages._

_Logic:_ 
* _Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"_
* _Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_

_However, 3 takes priority over 2, and 2 takes priority over 1._
_Ex:_ 
* _The 3 in 23 takes priority over the 2, so the message will be "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
* _The 2 in 21 takes priority over the 1, so the message will be "Boop"._
